# LidarMappingSystemProject

## Overview

Developed lidar sensor using VL5L0X ToF sensor, MSP432E401Y microcontroller using I2C and UART to construct a 3D point cloud of environment. Wrote driver software in C to interface 28BYK-49 motor with ULN-2003 driver board to allow for VL53L0X point cloud data acquisition. Converted point cloud data into .stl file using Open 3D in Python for visualization in 3D CAD software.
